### Session 1
Ok, so we are here, starting afresh and our problem we're trying to solve is as below:
 
Our mission (if we choose to accept) is to create an API, that will _"transfer"_ **money** between different bank **accounts**.

Ok, so it seems we already have a domain emerging out from our problem statement.

Nouns (Models) - _Money, Account_

Verbs (Behavior) - _transfer_

Let's see, if we can come up with some use cases for our problem. We'll maintain it in separate file called "UseCases.md".
